        Let's get into the real stuff. For starters I'm very open person who
        loves to innovate and try new things - that means, when working with me,
        you are going to things that are important. <b>Your idea.</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Every special idea needs special solution and for that we need special
        tools ðŸ˜‡. <br /> I usually go with Javascript <b>(Typescript only)</b>
        <br />
        for entire codebase, because I find it the most <b>productive ðŸ’ª</b>,
        but I have a wide range of expertise on other technologies as well ðŸ˜Ž.
        In the end its not about the language since its just a tool ðŸ¤«. <br />
