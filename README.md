## Special code design decisions 🤔

### Why NPM?

NPM is not as bad as it may look sometimes. Its better for most projects since its stricter and as of lately its faster than it was. Other than that NPM is for this small project enough 😉

### Why AstroJS?

This project was once written in NextJS (you can check git history) and since AstroJS was looking good for static projects I decided to try it and rewrite it. Speed is good and since this app will need less resources its even better 🍃

### Why TailwindCSS? 

I love TailwindCSS 💝 Many people hate TailwindCSS, but that may be that its misunderstood for what it is. It serves great purpose in FE space. Since I tried most of available tools for styling (such as CSS/Bootstrap/MUI/mantine/chakra/SCSS/emotion etc...) I decided to go for TailwindCSS because of these reasons: 
- It keeps me fast and reliable 🏎️
- I can control my codebase directly. No need to bend my code to Frameworks decisions (MUI or others) 💪
- I ship to client only whats directly needed 🪶
- It does not feel basic like plain CSS 🎇
- It makes me happy to write code 🤟
